This guide explains how to install Nginx and set it up as a basic web server. It also includes steps for configuring the firewall and backing up configuration files.

After installing Nginx, the service is started immediately and enabled to start automatically at boot. If everything is working correctly, the web server will begin listening on port 80.

Before editing the Nginx configuration file, be sure to create a backup. This allows you to restore the original settings in case of any configuration errors.

```sh
dnf -y install nginx
systemctl enable --now nginx

dnf -y install firewalld
systemctl enable --now firewalld
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
firewall-cmd --reload

cp -pv /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.bak
```

# DocumentRoot

`/usr/share/nginx/html`

By placing HTML files in this directory, you can serve content through the web server.
For example, if you place an index.html file here, it will be displayed when accessed via a web browser.


# Environment

```
[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/redhat-release
AlmaLinux release 10.0 (Purple Lion)
[root@localhost ~]#
```
