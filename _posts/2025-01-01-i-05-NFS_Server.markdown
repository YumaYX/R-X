# How to Set Up an NFS Server

This guide explains how to set up an NFS (Network File System) server. NFS is a protocol used to share directories with other machines over a network.

## Installation and Configuration

The following commands are used to set up the NFS server.

```sh
dnf -y update
dnf -y install nfs-utils firewalld

nfs_dir=/nfs
mkdir -p ${nfs_dir}
echo "${nfs_dir} 192.168.122.0/24(rw,no_root_squash)" > /etc/exports
# echo "${nfs_dir} *(rw,no_root_squash)" > /etc/exports

exportfs -ra

systemctl enable --now rpcbind nfs-server firewalld
systemctl restart rpcbind nfs-server firewalld
firewall-cmd --add-service=nfs --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
```

1. Update the system and install the necessary packages for NFS (`nfs-utils`) and the firewall management tool (`firewalld`).
2. Create the `/nfs` directory and add configuration to `/etc/exports` to make it accessible from clients.
3. Apply the export settings using the `exportfs -ra` command.
4. Enable and start the required services, and configure the firewall to allow NFS traffic.

## Mounting from the Client

On the client side, you can mount the NFS shared directory using the following command.

```sh
mount -t nfs <NFS server IP address>:/nfs /media
```

- Replace `<NFS server IP address>` with the actual IP address of your NFS server.
- `/media` is the mount point and can be changed to any directory you prefer.

By following these steps, you can set up a basic NFS server and share directories with other machines on your local network.
