Switching Between CUI and GUI on AlmaLinux 10

This guide outlines how to switch between CUI (text-based interface) and GUI (graphical interface) modes on AlmaLinux 10. It includes instructions for checking the current mode, installing the GUI, and setting the mode temporarily or permanently.

## Check Current Boot Mode

```sh
systemctl get-default
```

This command shows the current default target (boot mode) of the system:

- multi-user.target: CUI (command-line interface)
- graphical.target: GUI (graphical user interface)


## Set to CUI Mode

```sh
systemctl set-default multi-user.target
```

Sets the system to boot into CUI mode by default on the next restart. This mode is commonly used in server environments where a GUI is unnecessary.

## Set to GUI Mode

First, update all packages, then install the GUI environment (GNOME), and finally set the system to boot into GUI mode by default:

```sh
dnf -y update
dnf -y group install "Server with GUI"
systemctl set-default graphical.target
```

## Start GUI Immediately (Without Reboot)

If the GUI is already installed, you can switch to GUI mode immediately without rebooting:

```sh
systemctl isolate graphical.target
```
